Site : http://agarwalchirag.wordpress.com

This is a chat client between multiple clients over a common server. 
The clients can establish a connection on the server with a valid Username and Password. 
They can establish a connection with other clients over the server.
The chatting is then carried out P2P.

A client has the following commands to use :

\list :

Shows the list of the current clients connected to the server

\join :

Request to make a connection to the other client. The server responds to this command with "Whom do you wish to chat with ?".
The server then asks the other client if he wishes to chat with this user. If positive, a connection is established between the two clients.
They can now proceed to chat.
